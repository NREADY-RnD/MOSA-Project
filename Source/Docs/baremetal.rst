BareMetal Experiment
####################

**BareMetal** is an experimental Operating System with the design goal of utlitizing a single, common base of source code for all the high-level functions of the kernel. 

Platform specific low-level functions are incorporated using ``method plugs``, which acts similar to a method override.

.. warning:: BareMetal is experimental and incomplete.

The demo can be started by executing the following script: ``Demos\DEVELOPMENT-Run-Mosa.BareMetal.HelloWorld.x86.bat``.
